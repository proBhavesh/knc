Yeahh, I have comlete The Challenge in time, but with some glitches -- 

0. Website is completely developed in HTML and pure CSS.

1. Font is different from image.

2. Used an image to show map, not actual map from google API.

3. This website is not responsive, due to time constrain.
		I can make it responsive if given more time.

4. You can see it live here ---
